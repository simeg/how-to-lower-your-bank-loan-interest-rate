# How to Negotiate Interest Rate for Mortgage Loan in Sweden

**Note**: This is written for Swedish citizens.

I re-negotiated my interest rate with my bank and it was surprisingly easy. Here's a short step-by-step on how I did it. **Personally, I think the success rate will depend a lot on your income.**

1. Request an [amorteringsunderlag](https://www.google.com/search?q=amorteringsunderlag) from your bank. This document contains all the info that is needed for a new bank to take over the loan and **is a signal that you’re looking for a change**. This will usually trigger a call from your bank within a few days (at least it did for me, with _Swedbank_ as my bank). You can do this via your bank's website.
2. At the same time as step 1 you could enter your details on [Compricer](https://www.compricer.se/bolan/?type=omforhandla) and they will call you. For me it was pretty immediately. I had the luck of talking to someone who was very knowledgable, transparent and "told it like it is". Btw, the person you're talking to gets no provision for selling you anything. I got an offer of 2.45% from Skandia which was way better then the one I had with Swedbank. PS. My loan is not fixed.
3. When Swedbank called me, I simply said I've received an offer from Skandia that I'm planning to take. They’ll immediately switch into full “keep the customer at any cost” mode aka "kiss ass" mode and do what they can to make you stay. In my case, they matched the discount and lowered it by 0,01% so 2,44% without any further requirements. I have no savings account or anything atm with them, only a few insurances which she said it's OK to remove (which was initially part of the loan deal). The discount on the interest rate is valid for one year – so as I understand it, you should do this each year to optimize it.
4. Either accept their new offer or switch banks. I also managed to negotiate away other things such as insurance in this deal, so saving a bit more money each month.

**Overall time**: about 2 hrs where most of the time was spent talking to the guy from Compricer which I really enjoyed (we shared a few good laughs as well).

## General Recommendations
* **Renegotiate frequently**: As soon as your discount expires, do this process again
* **Every bank is different**: They will offer different requirements, needs, discounts etc. Some might require you to move all your savings there, your tjänstepension, your insurances etc.
* **Negotiation experience**: Outcomes can depend on the day, the person you talk to, and whether you have counter-offers from other banks. Some banks are more transparent or flexible than others.

Good luck and I hope your process will be as smooth as mine!
